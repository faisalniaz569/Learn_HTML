## Basic of Html

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

** Write some code in texteditor and save it index.html or index.htm
Than View the HTML Page in Your Browser.

Differences Between .htm and .html?
There is no difference between the .htm and .html file extensions!

Both will be treated as HTML by any web browser and web server.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>



</body>
</html>




How to View HTML Source:

Have you ever seen a Web page and wondered "Hey! How did they do that?"

View HTML Source Code:
Right-click in an HTML page and select "View Page Source" (in Chrome) or "View Source" (in Edge), or similar in other browsers. This will open a window containing the HTML source code of the page.

Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.
